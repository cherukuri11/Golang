Advantages of Go:
Runs fast
Garbage Collection
Simpler objects: essentially OOP
Concurrency is efficient


Runs Fast: Software Translation

Machine Language
Assembly language: Ex: ADD- like english
High Level Language: C,Java,Python,Go

Compiled vs Interpreted

Compiles only one time and executable machine code will be run during execution

Interpreted

Translate instructions while code is executed:
Java is partially both because it compiles and generates byte code and bytecode is translated during runtime(JVM)

Compiled code is faster


GOLANG:

Go is OOP but it is weakly OOP.
it implements obj but has limited features.
Encapsulation: group together data and functions which are related.

Object in Go:
Go not uses term class
It uses structs with associated methods
Struct is data,methods:
   No inheritance
   No constructors
   No Generics
Easier to code


Concurrency:

Moore's Law: no of transistors double every 18 months- not correct lately
clock frequencies: generate heat

Alternative is:

Parallelism: Cores in the Processor

Concurrent Programming: Management of multiple tasks at same time
Not executing at same time, but alive at same time

Concurrency in Go:
   concurrency primitives: easy to use
   GoRoutines- threads
   Channels- communicate btw tasks
   Select enables task synchronization:

Commands in go:

go build- compiles the code
do doc: prepares documentation
go fmt- format source code
go get- downloads the packages from web
go list- lists all packages
go run- runs the executable
go tests: runs test
